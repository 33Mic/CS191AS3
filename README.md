# Toyota Corolla
## But why?
Initially, I was searching for a product that I knew for sure had very different prices around the world so that it would be more interesting to do the data analysis, as there would be a multitude of reasons for the price differences. I was well aware that car prices are different around the world. Like in my country Pakistan, we have 200 percent import duties on cars, making it very expensive to buy a car, compared to a place like Dubai where there are barely any taxes when you buy a car.


*Note: We also kept in mind that a good product to use for our index should be something akin to being a necessity.*
